# Food Website FAQ Chatbot

This project is a chatbot built using **Dialogflow** for handling frequently asked questions (FAQ) and providing customer support on a food-related website. The chatbot assists users in various ways, including placing orders, tracking existing orders, viewing ongoing and upcoming offers, and providing store hours. It is designed to offer a smooth and efficient experience for customers, answering their queries and guiding them through the website's offerings.
